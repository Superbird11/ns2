# Kanban Boards

A Kanban board is a simple tool for moderating and illustrating workflow by showing the 
progress of various tasks related to a project. The board (a whiteboard can be used as an 
example) generally involves three or more columns - “To-do”, “In-progress”, and 
“complete”. In those columns are pasted various tasks, written for example on sticky 
notes, that need to be done – the column a note is in describes  the current state of the 
task. Additional steps can be added in between “To-do” and “complete” if there are more 
steps that need to be taken with elements in the project.   

What a Kanban board allows is organization of work, and quick visualization both of how 
much work needs to be done and how efficiently that work is being accomplished. 
Bottlenecks in the process can be seen at a glance and work distribution can be modified 
accordingly. Above all, this system is simple – all it really needs in a local environment 
is a whiteboard and some sticky notes – and accessible both to workers and outsiders who 
are interested in the progress of the work.
