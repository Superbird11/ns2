# Markdown

Markdown is a multipurpose document type used for easy conversion to other file formats, 
mainly HTML, but without the need for knowing complicated code. For example, a content
writer and a web developer could work together to build a website, with the designer
handling all the style and the content writer simply writing everything in Markdown.  

## Benefits of Markdown

The benefit of Markdown is that its format is simple and can be easily converted to a
multitude of other file formats. In particular, it's often used to convert to HTML or
to an E-mail, as the former requires HTML code that, while not necessarily difficult, is
rather time consuming, and the latter may not provide the ability to do *styling* inside
the program. It's also compatible with many blogging websites and wikis. Markdown 
documents are saved with the file extension ".md".  

- You can also create bullet-point lists simply by typing them.  
- *Italics* can be done with single-asterisks on either side of text.  
- Similarly, **boldface** uses two asterisks instead of one.  
- ```code``` can be done with three accent characters on either side. Note: Do not do this
with three single-apostrophes. It will not work.
